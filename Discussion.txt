Ideas:
-Questions we want answered:
Do the various criteria for success (critic reviews, audience reviews, profit/loss) correlate with each other? Is there something you can say about better or worse kinds of “success”?
Can you predict review scores from other data we have about the movie? Maybe genre determines a lot about the success or a movie? Or maybe the actors?
Does the plot summary predict success in any useful way? (See “Natural Language Processing” below.)
What specific factors are related to a movie's success? Which are the most related? Is paying Vin Diesel worth it?
Have any of these things changed over time (depending on the movie's release date)? Maybe people in the past liked documentaries more than we do now.
-Statistical tests we need to use:
-Machine Learning concepts we need to use:
