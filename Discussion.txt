I'm thinking movies is the easiest to do movies.


Timeline: (Due Friday August 02 2019 )

By July 3:
-Agree on questions we want to answer
-find tests we need to do
-understand what machine learning we need to do
-understand additional things: API, tools....
-assign tasks

By July 11:
-get all data needed for tests

By July 17:
-do statistical tests

By July 22:
-do machine learning

By July 26:
-finish project and report

By July 30 : SUBMIT


Ideas:
I think two statisical and one machine learning question is enough
to start. We can add more if we need to.

Type of Questions we can ask:
  Statistical:
    assingment 4 : is there any correlation between population density and temperature?
    assignment 5 :  are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?
    assignment 5: do the number of comments on weekends and weekdays for each week differ?”
    assingment 6: Did more users use the search feature? ,
    assign 7 : have the ratings given by this Twitter account been changing over time?
    Statistcal test lecture:
      - Is there any difference in height between SFU, UBC, and UVic students?


  Machine Learning:
    assignment 8 : Create a program weather_city.py that reads the labelled data and trains and validates a machine learning model for the best possible results. It should then predict the cities where the unlabelled 2016 weather came from.
    Classification lecture:
     -Is this email spam? Is this credit card charge fraud? (2 categories)
     -What (English) word did the user say into the microphone? (≈470k categories *)
      -What day will the Grouse Grind open next year? (≪365 categories) Or is that regression?
      -How many people are in this picture? Who are the people?
      -Given weather observations, can you guess what city are we looking at?

  - More ideas Questions we want answered:
  Coorelation between box office profit and critic scores?
  Coorelation between budget and box office?
  Prof suggestions:
  Do the various criteria for success (critic reviews, audience reviews, profit/loss) correlate with each other? Is there something you can say about better or worse kinds of “success”?
  Can you predict review scores from other data we have about the movie? Maybe genre determines a lot about the success or a movie? Or maybe the actors?
  Does the plot summary predict success in any useful way? (See “Natural Language Processing” below.)
  What specific factors are related to a movie's success? Which are the most related? Is paying Vin Diesel worth it?
  Have any of these things changed over time (depending on the movie's release date)? Maybe people in the past liked documentaries more than we do now.


  QUESTIONS WE WANT ANSWERED AND WHAT TESTS TO USE FOR EACH ONE:
    -looking at plot to see what genere movie we are looking at
    - Do people like the first movie in a series better than the rest
    - coorelation between number of awards and critic scores?
